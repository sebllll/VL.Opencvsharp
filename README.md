# VL.Opencvsharp

if someone wants to try, one needs:

- opencvsharp from https://github.com/shimat/opencvsharp/releases (i took 2.4.10)
- opencv dlls from https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/2.4.10/ (the x86 dlls from "\opencv\build\x86\vc12\bin"  must be placed in the opencvsharp folder)

then open the patch and probably add all opencvsharp dlls (the ones from the first download) via drag n drop or menu.
